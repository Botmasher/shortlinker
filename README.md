# Shortlinker

This project is a bookmark server or URL-shortening service with no persistent storage.
Building began from an exercise for the Udacity [HTTP web servers](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud303) class.

This server accepts a URL and a short name, check that the URL actually
works (returns an HTTP 200), then stores it in a Python dictionary.

See `ShortmakerServer.py` for main code and exercise instructions.
